# common-lisp-project-ideas
Anyone can freely set up issues of your tastes and discuss future project ideas.

There are several purposes in this repository:

+ to find the next possible "killer app" in common lisp, as in expert systems
+ to import some of the best practices from the other languages (and to enhance it)
+ to avoid duplicated efforts, and enhance cooperation between people with similar goals

The focus is on the fundamental value of the ecosystem than um, the hobby projects (i.e. w/o future users in mind).
